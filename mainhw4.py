# 1. Processing JSON file and creation of a graph G

# Import the data set:

data = ps.json.load(open('/Users/gaetanocirianni/reduced_dblp.json'))

# Find the ID for a specific author:

ps.author_id(data, 'aris anagnostopoulos')

# Given the author's ID, find her/his publications:

ps.publications_for_author_id(data, 256176)

# Create the set of all author IDs in order to build the graph:

list_of_authors_IDs = ps.return_all_the_authors_IDs(data)
len(list_of_authors_IDs)

# Graph:

G = g.create_graph(list_of_authors_IDs)
g.plot_graph(G)

# We need a dictionary containing all the publications for a given author
# in order to give a relationship author-publication:

# Find a list of IDs for the authors that have partecipated to a conference
# ('id_conference_int' in input):   

author_conf_list = ps.authors_for_conference(data, 3052)

# (a): Given the conference in input, return the subgraph induced by the set
# of authors who have published at the input conference at least once. 

confG = g.subgraph(graph=G, lis=author_conf_list) 

g.plot_subgraph(lis=author_conf_list, subgraph=confG)

# # Now we have the graph. Computation of some centralities measures and plot them.

# Closeness centrality:
# Represents the mean distance between a given node and all the others.   

stat.closeness(confG)
stat.plot_closeness(confG)

# Betweeness centrality:
# It is a measure of centrality based on the shortest paaths.
# Fore every pair of vertices in a conncted graph, there exists at least one
#  shortest path between the vertices such that the sum of the weights of the edegs,
# for a weighted graph is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each vertex 
# is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.

stat.betweeness(confG)
stat.plot_betweeness(confG)

# Degree centrality:
# Degree is a simple centrality measure that counts how many neighbors a node has.

stat.degree(confG)
stat.plot_degree(confG)

# (b): Given in input an author and an integer d, get the subgraph induced by
# the nodes that have hop distance at most equal to d with the input author.
# Then, visualize the graph.

list_neighbors = g.neighbourhood(a= 43, dist= 5, graph= G)

# 3. Compute some generalized version of the Erdos number
# (a): Verify the presence of a path between Aris and the input author:

authorID = int(input("Enter the ID of the author you want to compute the distance from Aris: "))
d.nx.has_path(G, source = authorID, target = 256176)

d.Dijkstra(G, authorID, 256176)

#(b): Take in input a subset of nodes (cardinality smaller than 21) and returns,
# for each node of the graph, its GroupNumber, defined as the minimum SP
# between u and v, where v is a node in the graph and u belongs to I,
# which is the set of input nodes.
